lineup
======

Android App that allows planning events on fairs, parties or for personal use

LineUp is a Android App that is designed to make timing on a Event more easy
The Idea emerged because of the preference to 'meet in an hour' rather than 'at
15:00'. Especially when being on a Event and time is not the thing that matters.


fix the problems by replacing them with useful algorithms, prefably with
the same indent no \t

maybe more useful: the buildable examples for your project.
just clone the git, understand whats going on by _reading_, then
have your personal 'requests whatever webservice to display notifies'

dont even know if there are more efficient frameworks.
gui code needs testing, battery empty.
