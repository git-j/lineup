<h1>LineUp</h1>
<p>LineUp is a Android App that is designed to make timing on a Festival more easy</p>
<p>The Idea emerged because of the preference to 'meet in an hour' rather than 'at 15:00'. Especialy when being on a festival and time is not the thing that matters</p>
<p>The current state of the software is beta, it means that it should already work as expected, but unless you report bugs this aint certain. Also the Data that is input
cannot yet be exported or shared, so you could enter the complete Festival 2012, but your friend next to you also has to do this. Test it, Try it. Request features and we
will implement a sync-schedule in the meantime, that you can update with the little bandwith that will be available on a Festival.</p>

<h2>Install</h2>
<p>Download the App and install it on your device. It has been tested on LG-P350, a very small and inexpensive device - something that can be lost or damaged on a festival.</p>
<p>After installing the Widget you should open it and Download/Initialize the database with events. This Events represent a 4-Track festival from 2009, that happens to start Today at 17:00</p>
<p>Now you can add the desktop Widget to a Homescreen that provides enough space</p>

<h2>Use</h2>
<p>And the upcoming events should be displayed</p>

<div class="cl"></div>
<p>When you tap on the widget, you will see the Events that are currently happening (+- 15minutes)</p>
<p>Tapping On a Event will activate or deactivate it. Deactivated events will not apear on the Widget, but you can see it in the Futures List</p>
<img src="lineup-select-now.png"/>
<p>The Buttons on the top allow you to filter the Events. </p>

<img src="lineup-select-past.png"/>
<p>Events can be deleted by long-tapping a event and select 'Delete' from the context menu</p>
</div>
<div class="block">
<h2>New</h2>
<p>To add new Events you use the New Button</p>
<p>New Events are useful when you want to meet persons or attend Events that are not on the Schedule</p>
<p>You can create your own places and Persons you meet. The last used Person & Place is always selected when you enter the next event</p>
<p>The Time of a Event can eigher be set using 'Real' time and a date as well as by setting a offset from now. So its super-easy to meet in 45 minutes</p>
<img src="lineup-new.png"/>
<p>The Events you entered can be displayed with the 'My' filter. The Events are also highlighted in the Future List as well as on the Widget</p>
